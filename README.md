# PHPSpec & Prophecy: An Introduction to BDD Test Doubles

This repository contains the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "PHPSpec & Prophecy: An Introduction to BDD Test Doubles".

In this video, we continue our exploration of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) with PHPSpec by introducing Prophecy, its integrated test double framework. This project demonstrates how to use Prophecy to create Mocks and Spies, which help you control dependencies and write more expressive specifications.

## What You'll Learn

  - How Prophecy simplifies the creation of test doubles in PHPSpec.
  - The core concepts of Mocks and Spies within a BDD context.
  - Writing clear, living specifications that also function as tests.
  - The benefits of integrating a test double framework into your BDD workflow.
